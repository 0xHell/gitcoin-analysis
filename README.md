# gitcoin-analysis
Gitcoin grants analysis tool

# Intro
I made a prototype to analyze and predict Gitcoin Grant rounds. I didnt put all the charts in my analysis but if you need to see a specific chart (function and the parameters that made the chart are shown above them) just change function parameters to the thing you want. Ill plan on making an API/CLI to make this easier but after some refactoring and upgrading to fancy looking charts.
sorry my english is not very good but ill do my best.
